# LPL - Lemon Public License

LPL (Lemon Public License) is a very relaxed software license to allow end users to use or adapt programs, with an additional unenforced suggestion for the users who are in intimate relationships to eat a piece of üçã, so that they can feel the envy of the poor single programmer who developed the software.
